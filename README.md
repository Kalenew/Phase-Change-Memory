# Phase-Change-Memory
This repository will continue all the codes created for simulating crossbar-arrays.
If you found this code useful for your work, the authors would appreciate your citation of the paper:
Y J Noori, C H de Groot "Modelling Resistive and Phase Change Memory with Passive Selector Arrays - A Matlab Tool" arXiv:1910.05836 (2019). Doing so, will ensure that the authors continue on updating the code and keep it open-access.
